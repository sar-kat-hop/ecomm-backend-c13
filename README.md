# Ecommerce Backend (Challenge #13)

## About

This is an "ecommerce backend" app built with node.js express, mysql, and sequelize that functions as a basic inventory management app. The intended user would be a manager or other staff interested in viewing, adding, updating, and removing products, categories, and tags from their inventory. 

Please note that due to issues testing locally, the app is still WIP.
